**BrusselSportPortal** is a web application I developed from scratch as part of the *Web Technologies* course at VUB. The primary goal of this project was to create a modern Web 2.0 application that provides users with a portal to create and join sports events in the Brussels area.

### Features:
- Users can create, manage, and join sport events.
- Real-time updates for event changes.
- User authentication and profile management.
- Interactive UI for a seamless user experience.

### Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** Built with **Node.js** and **Express** for handling API requests, authentication, and data management.
- **Frontend:** Developed using **React.js**, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Database:** Data is stored and managed with **MySQL**, utilizing a relational database model to handle event data and user information.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Gained hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application.
- Integrated front-end and back-end technologies to create a seamless user experience.
- Worked with relational databases to store and manage user data effectively.
- Applied Web 2.0 principles for an interactive and community-driven platform.
